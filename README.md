# PokeBoxMC-Commands
**This project was for a Minecraft server that is not existing in this form anymore!**

This plugin aimed to bring short informational commands to the now-closed PokeBoxMC server, like ´/discord´, ´/spawn´ or ´/announce´. With small modifications, I'm sure that it could be adjusted for other servers aswell.
